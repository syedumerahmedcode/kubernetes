## Kuberenetes
- K8s is a open source container orchestration tool.
- It helps you _manage containerized applications_(Container are mostly created in docker but it can be any other container technology).
- K8s helps in managing containers in different _deployment_ environments. 
- - It can be physical, virtual, cloud or even hybrid environemnts.

### What problems does k8s solve?

- Trend from _Monolith_ to _Microservices_.
- This resulted in a _increased usage of containers_.
- Demand of a proper way of _managing_ those hundreds of containers.

### What are the tasks of an orchestration tool?

- _High availability_(or no downtime)
- _Scalibility_(Scalable web applications are capable of handling increased user traffic and growing demands without compromising performance)
- _Disaster recovery_(backup and restore)

## Kubernetes Components

### Node
- A simple server - a physical or virtual machine.

### Pod
- Smallest unit K8s.
- It is an abstraction over the container.
- -  Note: We do not work with the underlying container technology but rather we only interact with the Kubernetes layer.
- Usually, one application runs per pod. 
- Each pod gets its own IP address(_not the container but the pod itself gets an IP address_).
- Please note that pods are ephemeral ion nature i.e. they can die very easily. When that happens, a new pod is created which takes place of the recently deceased pod.
- New IP address on re-creation of a pod.

### Services
- This creates a permenant IP address for the pod.
- The lifecycles of the service and the pod are **not** connected. This means that if the pod dies, the service and its IP address will remain.This means that the endpoint remains the same.
